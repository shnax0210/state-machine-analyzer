# State machine analyzer

Provides ability to model various systems as state machine 
and check if the state machine has only valid states, transactions and paths.

The functionality inspired by [TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) 
and has a goal to provide something similar but written in javascript and thus more adoptable by developers.

There is also [UI application](https://github.com/shnax0210/state-machine-analyzer-ui) that uses this module as dependency 
and provides UI experience to work with.

You can find the application deployed by next links:
